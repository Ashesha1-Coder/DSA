what is array ?

An array is a collection of elements, all of the same type, stored in contiguous memory locations. In Python, you typically use lists for this purpose.

Why we use it ?
 Arrays allow you to store multiple items under a single name and access them via indexes.

what is hashing?
Hashing is a technique used to map data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values, called hash codes or hashes. It’s used in hash tables (or dictionaries in Python) to efficiently retrieve, insert, and delete data. The key-value pairs are stored in the hash table, and a hashing function determines where the keys and values are stored.

Why we use it?
The magic of hashing lies in its ability to quickly find an item's storage location based on the item’s key, making it incredibly efficient for large datasets
